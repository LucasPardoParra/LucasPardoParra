## Hi there ğŸ‘‹

It's me, Lucas! Here's some infor about myself:

- ğŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on some personal projects I'll be uploading soon.
- ğŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning WebApp Development at Universidad Europea, in Madrid
- ğŸ“« How to reach me: please don't xD 
- ğŸ˜„ Pronouns: (what?)
- âš¡ Fun fact: any non-fun fact is a fun fact itself just because it isn't. Pretty good, huh?
